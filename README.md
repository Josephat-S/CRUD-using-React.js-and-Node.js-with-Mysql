# CRUD Application using React.js, Node.js, and MySQL

A full-stack web application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The frontend is built with **React.js**, the backend uses **Node.js** (with Express), and data is persisted in a **MySQL** database. This project is a practical example for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand how to connect a React frontend to a Node.js backend with a relational database.

## üöÄ Features

- **Create** new records in the database via an intuitive UI.
- **Read** and display existing records in a dynamic table.
- **Update** existing records with inline editing or dedicated forms.
- **Delete** records with confirmation prompts for safety.
